            <b>A Wheatfield with Cypresses</b> (occasionally called A Cornfield with Cypresses)
            is any of three similar 1889 oil paintings by Vincent van Gogh, as part of his
            wheat field series. All were exhibited at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole mental
            asylum at Saint-RÃ©my near Arles, France, where Van Gogh was voluntarily a
            patient from May 1889 to May 1890. The works were inspired by the view from the
            window at the asylum towards the Alpilles mountains.
